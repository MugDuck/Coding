# Seeker
<i>Seeker</i> is a quick and easy/ fun game to play. The rules are very simple. There is a random number chosen by the program. Your goal is to find and guess that number. Be wary. If your guess is heading in the right direction it will encourage you by saying that you are getting warmer. If you guess too far or miss the mark by a small amount, then the program will warn you by saying that you are getting colder. The guesing will continue to proceed until the number is found.
